## Intro to Unity Workshop

Hello again, workshop attendees!

This repo contains the Unity project from the 2/1/2020 Intro to Unity Workshop @ Playcrafting's GGJ site in the Microsoft building.

You can find everything we made in the workshop in the **Assets** directory; additionally, the **Assets/_DryRun** directory contains some extra scripts and simple examples of things like custom **Scriptable Objects** and basic usage of the Unity UI system from a longer form of the workshop that I used to prepare for the presentation.
